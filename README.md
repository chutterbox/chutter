## What's chutter
Chutter is a new reddit competitor. Its focuses on the things that are broken with reddit, namely: 
* Content awareness / ease of sumbission - reddit/voat is pretty much optimized for funny cat pictures and text posts. The goal is to expand this to music, videos, and better webpage submissions
* Better moderation tooling, natively
* Notifications and transparency - If something is removed, someone is banned, etc... there should be an audit trail of this. 
* Much better categorization - Apparently on reddit and voat, there is no distinction categorically between fatpeoplehate and aww, separating these communities in to appropriate 'networks' empowers people to filter out content that *offends* them (sobs)
