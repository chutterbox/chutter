- user banning
  - a user ban will ban a user from commenting or posting, they can still be subscribed at this time



  banning a user:
    - subscribe a user to the community notifications channel (specific to user), i.e. community:12:notofications:user:33

    - create activity log entry that the user has been banned
      - action: banned
      - entity: user
      - user:   mod
      - detailed_explanation: boom
      - rule_id : rule

    - add them to community:<id>:banlist

    - then when the user tries to post or comment, check the ban list first
    - when loading the community, zcard the ban list for the user
